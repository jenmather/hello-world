# hello-world
My first repository using the tutorial guide.
My name is Jen and I started a data science specialization that has 10 courses that should help me
better understand what data science is and how to be a data analyst.
IÊ»ve only ever coded in HTML and some CSS, so this is very different,
but I am hoping to understand this all soon.
